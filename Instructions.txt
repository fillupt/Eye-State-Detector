Python 3.12 (e.g. 3.12.10)
Add to PATH during install.

Python 3.12 (recommended)

Quick start (launcher-first)

1) Create and activate a virtual environment (PowerShell)

   py -3.12 -m venv eye-env
   .\eye-env\Scripts\Activate.ps1

2) Install dependencies

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3) Use the launcher (preferred)

   The launcher is the primary entry point for this project. It manages configuration, provides a small GUI for selecting
   task files and options (Setup...), and starts/stops the detector process. Run:

   C:\git\Eye-State-Detector\eye-env\Scripts\python.exe c:\git\Eye-State-Detector\launcher.py

   From within the launcher you can:
   - Enter a name, choose a save directory, and press Start.
   - Open Setup... to select the three task files (Reading / Video / Interactive) and toggle SANDE / OSDI-6 options. Selections are
	 persisted to `launcher_config.json` in the repo root.
   - The launcher starts `Eye_State_Detector.py` as a child process and polls for `tracker.ready` to know when initialization is complete.

4) Running the detector directly (advanced)

   You can run `Eye_State_Detector.py` directly for debugging, but note the launcher is intended to be the master controller.
   When you run the detector directly it will still function, but it will not receive the launcher-managed configuration (task files,
   save directory, or option flags) unless you pass them manually.

   Example (direct run):

   C:\git\Eye-State-Detector\eye-env\Scripts\python.exe c:\git\Eye-State-Detector\Eye_State_Detector.py

Notes

- Configuration persisted by the launcher lives in `launcher_config.json` (repo root). The detector writes `tracker.ready` when it
  finishes initialization; the launcher watches that file to update its UI.
- `eye_state_detection.ipynb` was removed in favor of a script-first workflow.
- The virtual environment directory `eye-env/` is gitignored to avoid committing large files.

If you want the launcher to pass selected task files and flags to `Eye_State_Detector.py`, I can add safe CLI flags and wire them
up so the detector receives those values. For now the launcher remains the master and the detector is left unchanged.
