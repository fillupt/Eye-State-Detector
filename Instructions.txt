Python 3.12 (e.g. 3.12.10)
Add to PATH during install.

Open terminal (e.g. PowerShell)
```plaintext
Recommended environment & setup

1) Install Python 3.12 (or compatible 3.11/3.12). Add it to PATH when installing if you want `py`/`python` available from the terminal.

2) Create a virtual environment (local to the project)

	Open PowerShell in the project root and run:

	py -3.12 -m venv eye-env

3) Install dependencies

	Use the venv's Python to install pinned dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

	# activate the venv (PowerShell)
	.\eye-env\Scripts\Activate.ps1

	# then install
	pip install -r requirements.txt

	Alternatively (no activation needed), run:
	C:\git\Eye-State-Detector\eye-env\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt

4) Run the detector script

	python Eye_State_Detector.py

5) Open the notebook

	You can open `eye_state_detection.ipynb` in VS Code (recommended) or in Jupyter Lab/Notebook:

		python Eye_State_Detector.py

	Notes

	- The repository no longer includes the full `eye-env/` virtual environment. The `.gitignore` file excludes `eye-env/` to avoid committing large binary packages.
	- If you previously committed `eye-env/` and want to untrack it (already done if you removed it from the index), use:

	  git rm -r --cached .\eye-env
	  git commit -m "Remove committed virtualenv; add to .gitignore"

	- `eye_state_detection.ipynb` (the Jupyter notebook) has been removed from the repository — this project is now script-first. Use `Eye_State_Detector.py` to run the detector.

	If you want, I can also:
	- produce a trimmed `requirements.txt` (only the minimal packages needed by the project),
	- convert parts of the notebook logic into a cleaned module or CLI, or
	- help purge the venv from git history entirely (useful when repo size must be reduced).
